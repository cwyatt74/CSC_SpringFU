  <h1>Chapter 4-6</h1>
		<p class= ""p-welcome"> </p>

		  <p><span class="cite">4.1</span>   Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, I have produced a man with the help of the LORD.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.2</span>   Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.3</span>   In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, </p>
			<p><span class="cite">4.4</span>   and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.5</span>   but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.6</span>   The LORD said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen? </p>
			<p><span class="cite">4.7</span>   If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.8</span>   Cain said to his brother Abel, Let us go out to the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.9</span>   Then the LORD said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel? He said, I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.10</span>   And the LORD said, What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.11</span>   And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.12</span>   When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.13</span>   Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear!</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.14</span>   Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me. </p>
			<p><span class="cite">4.15</span>   Then the LORD said to him, Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance. And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.16</span>   Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.17</span>   Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.18</span>   To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.19</span>   Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.20</span>   Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock. </p>
			<p><span class="cite">4.21</span>   His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.22</span>   Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.23</span>   Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. </p>
			<p><span class="cite">4.24</span>   If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.25</span>   Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.</p>
		  <p><span class="cite">4.26</span>   .To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.1</span>  This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.2</span>  Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Humankind when they were created.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.3</span>  When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.4</span>  The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.5</span>  Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.6</span>  When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.7</span>  Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.8</span>  Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.9</span>  When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.10</span>  Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.11</span>  Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.12</span>  When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.13</span>  Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.14</span>  Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.15</span>  When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.16</span>  Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.17</span>  Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.18</span>  When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.19</span>  Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.20</span>  Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.21</span>  When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.22</span>  Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.23</span>  Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.24</span>  Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.25</span>  When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.26</span>  Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.27</span>  Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.28</span>  When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.29</span>  he named him Noah, saying, Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.30</span>  Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">5.31</span>  Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
			<p><span class="cite">5.32</span> After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.1</span>  When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.2</span>  the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.2</span>  Then the LORD said, My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.3</span>  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.4</span>  The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.5</span>  And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.6</span>  So the LORD said, I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created - people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.7</span>  But Noah found favor in the sight of the LORD.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.8</span>  These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.9</span>  And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.10</span>  Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.11</span>  And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.12</span>  And God said to Noah, I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.12</span>  Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.14</span>  This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.15</span>  Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.16</span>  For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.17</span>  But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.18</span>  And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.19</span>  Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.20</span>  Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.</p>
			<p><span class="cite">6.21</span>  Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.</p>
