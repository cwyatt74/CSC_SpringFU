  <h1>Chapter 13-15</h1>
		<p class= ""p-welcome"> </p>

		<p><span class="cite">13.1</span> So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.2</span> Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.3</span> He journeyed on by stages from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.4</span> to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.5</span> Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.6</span> so that the land could not support both of them living together; for their possessions were so great that they could not live together,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.7</span> and there was strife between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.8</span> Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.9</span> Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.10</span> Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the LORD had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.11</span> So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.12</span> Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.13</span> Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.14</span> The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.15</span> for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.16</span> I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">13.17</span> Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you. [13:18] So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the LORD.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.1</span> In the days of King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.2</span> these kings made war with King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.3</span> All these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.4</span> Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.5</span> In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh- kiriathaim,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.6</span> and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the edge of the wilderness;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.7</span> then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.8</span> Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.9</span> with King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar, four kings against five.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.10</span> Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.11</span> So the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.12</span> they also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.13</span> Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner; these were allies of Abram. </p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.14</span> When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.15</span> He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and routed them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.16</span> Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his nephew Lot with his goods, and the women and the people.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.17</span> After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). </p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.18</span> And King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of God Most High.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.19</span> He blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High, maker of heaven and earth;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.20</span> and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand! And Abram gave him one tenth of everything.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.21</span> Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.22</span> But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have sworn to the LORD, God Most High, maker of heaven and earth,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.23</span> that I would not take a thread or a sandal-thong or anything that is yours, so that you might not say, 'I have made Abram rich.'</p>
		<p><span class="cite">14.24</span> I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me - Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their share.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.1</span> After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.2</span> But Abram said, O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.3</span> And Abram said, You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.4</span> But the word of the LORD came to him, This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.5</span> He brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them. Then he said to him, So shall your descendants be.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.6</span> And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.7</span> Then he said to him, I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.8</span> But he said, O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.9</span> He said to him, Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.10</span> He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.11</span> And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away. </p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.12</span> As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.13</span> Then the LORD said to Abram, Know this for certain, that your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs, and shall be slaves there, and they shall be oppressed for four hundred years;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.14</span> but I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.15</span> As for yourself, you shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.16</span> And they shall come back here in the fourth generation; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.17</span> When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.18</span> On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.19</span> the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.20</span> the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">15.21</span> the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites..</p>
