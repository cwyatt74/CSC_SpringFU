  	<h1> Reflective Essay of CSC 270-01</h1>
    <p> My academic major is an B.S in Information Technology, the reason behind me choosing this degree is a long and complicated one, but defiant reason I chose this degree is because my brother is in the Air Force and is apart of the cyber warfare unit. With him being in this job he started talking to me about perusing a degree in the computer field. The main skill I learned in this class was to effectively use a .map which does something to everything in a particular collection of text through our class. An example of this would be the space between our text if you did not use a map the text could possible not line up exactly the same and in a business setting if for example an HTML page is not lined up it will make you seem unprofessional. Another area that was important in this class was the use of a .filter function which allowed us to pull out specific things in our text. Another important area that I feel was very beneficial to me was the use of markdown, which is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It allows us to be able to convert to many out formats, which was very beneficial for the Readme file. The final beneficial thing I learned in this class was how to implement text into an HTML file and publish it to the internet for everyone to see. I found this very interesting and possibly beneficial in my job field in the future.
