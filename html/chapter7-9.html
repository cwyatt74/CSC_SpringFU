  <h1>Chapter 7-9</h1>
		<p class= ""p-welcome"> </p>

		<p><span class="cite">7.1</span> Then the LORD said to Noah, Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.2</span> Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.3</span> and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.4</span> For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.5</span> And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.6</span> Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.7</span> And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.8</span> Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.9</span> two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.10</span> And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.12</span> The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.13</span> On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.14</span> they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind - every bird, every winged creature.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.15</span> They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.16</span> And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.17</span> The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.18</span> The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.19</span> The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.20</span> the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.21</span> And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.22</span> everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.23</span> He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">7.24</span> And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.1</span> But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.2</span> the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.3</span> and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.4</span> and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.5</span> The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.6</span> At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.7</span> and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.8</span> Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.9</span> but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.10</span> He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.11</span> and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.12</span> Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.13</span> In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.14</span> In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.15</span> Then God said to Noah,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.16</span> Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you. [8:17] Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.17</span> So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.18</span> And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.19</span> Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.20</span> And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">8.21</span> As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.1</span> God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.2</span> The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.3</span> Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.4</span> Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.5</span> For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.6</span> Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in his own image God made humankind.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.7</span> And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.8</span> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.9</span> As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, </p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.10</span> and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.11</span> I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.12</span> God said, This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.13</span> I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.14</span> When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.15</span> I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.16</span> When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.17</span> God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.18</span> The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.19</span> These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled. </p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.20</span> Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.21</span> He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.22</span> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.23</span> Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.24</span> When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him, </p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.25</span> he said, Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.26</span> He also said, Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave. </p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.27</span> May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.28</span> After the flood Noah lived three hundred fifty years.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">9.29</span> All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.</p>
