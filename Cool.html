<h1 style="color: white; text-align: center"> Genesis 1</h1>
    <p><span class="cite">1.1</span> In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,</p>
    <p><span class="cite">1.2</span> the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.</p>
    <p><span class="cite">1.3</span> Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.</p>
    <p><span class="cite">1.4</span> And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.</p>
    <p><span class="cite">1.5</span> God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.6</span> And God said, "Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.7</span> So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.8</span> God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.</p>
    <p><span class="cite">1.9</span> And God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.10</span> God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.11</span> Then God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it." And it was so.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.12</span> The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
		<p><span class="cite">1.13</span> And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.14</span> And God said, "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.15</span> and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth." And it was so.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.16</span> God made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.17</span> God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.18</span> to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.19</span> And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.20</span> And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky."</p>
		<p><span class="cite">1.21</span> So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
