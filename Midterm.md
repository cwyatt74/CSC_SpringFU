## What is a N-gram ? ##

 N-grams of texts are **extensively** used in **text mining** and **natural language processing tasks**. They are basically a set of co-occuring words within a given window and when computing the n-grams you typically move one word forward.

## How are N-grams used in various disciplines? ##

N-grams are used for a variety of different task. For example, when developing a language model, n-grams are used to develop not just unigram models but also bigram and trigram models. **Google** and **Microsoft** have developed web scale n-gram models that can be used in a variety of tasks such as **spelling correction**, **word breaking** and **text summarization**. Another use of n-grams is for developing features for supervised Machine Learning models such as **SVMs, MaxEnt models, Naive Bayes, etc**.

 ## How N-grams are used in humanities, sciences, and business/industry. ##

   Google uses N-grams for  Looking at changes in the frequencies of these n-grams over time, the authors seek to watch cultural change happening---not just qualitatively, but, they claim, quantitatively.

## Steps necessary to find N-grams. ##

If X=Num of words in a given sentence K, the number of n-grams for sentence K would be:





## methods in Scala that might be useful for N-grams. ##

find likely candidates for the correct spelling of a misspelled word
improve compression in compression algorithms where a small area of data requires n-grams of greater length
